## THIS IS JUST A MODIFICATION OF THE Alphares PROGRAM TO BE UPDATED WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GAME (Changes the Lobby FPS Limit "FrontendFrameRateLimit" as well). All credits go to the ORIGINAL creator, Braycarlson!

## alphares
alphares is a tool for Windows to save custom settings in Fortnite.

I made this tool when it was possible to customize Fortnite's resolution via a configuration file, however, Fortnite changed that sometime after the release of this project. As of late, I have noticed alphares appearing in YouTube and TikTok videos, so it might be possible to change the resolution of Fortnite again, but I am unable confirm it, as I no longer play the game. If you want to download this tool, then please do so from [here](https://github.com/braycarlson/alphares/releases/tag/1.2.1) as it is the safest option.

## Note
* You must have launched Fortnite at least once, and allowed the game to detect the best settings or saved custom settings in-game before running alphares.
* alphares can set/unset the configuration file's read-only attribute. This is to prevent Fortnite from updating the configuration file and resetting the custom resolution. As such, you will be unable to save settings in-game while it is set. You must uncheck the read-only box and press "Apply" to save changes.
* If you want to have an uncapped framerate in Fortnite, you must set the FPS field to `0` in alphares.

## To-do
* Draw an outline on the `Apply` button when focused
* Customize and change the color of the `BS_GROUPBOX` rectangle
* Redraw the radio buttons
